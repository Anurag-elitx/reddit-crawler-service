Reddit Miner

Reddit Miner is an open-source, AI-assisted pipeline designed to discover, scrape, and structure Reddit conversations. The goal of the project is to make Reddit data easy to collect, clean, and use for research, analysis, and application development.

The system is built with Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and large language models (LLMs). It focuses on reliability, fault tolerance, and clean data output. Reddit Miner can automatically discover relevant threads, extract posts and comments, process the data in the background, and convert raw Reddit text into structured formats suitable for downstream tasks. It is designed to be extensible, allowing developers and researchers to add new extractors, processing steps, or AI models based on their needs.

Reddit Miner provides a flexible, maintainable architecture for anyone looking to work with large-scale Reddit data in a consistent and automated way.
